* Proposal Suggestions
** A/B Testing
*** Layout the forms differently for randomly-selected users. Compare relative speeds via statistical analysis of A/B data
** Invest now to be well positioned in the future
*** Not too many competitors in the initial price range
*** Find an immediate partner to do testing with (set a hard deadline in the goals layout)
** Suggest forcing incremental changes - combine programming/networking/sysadmin expertise to reduce overall TCO
*** Web interface lends itself to easing upgrades
